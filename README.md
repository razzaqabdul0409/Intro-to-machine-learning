These repositories help you for better understanding of Machine Learning Models


Like every first app you should start with something super simple that shows the overall scaffolding for how your code works.

In the case of creating neural networks, the sample I like to use is one where it learns the relationship between two numbers

So how would you train a neural network to do the equivalent task? Using data! By feeding it with a set of Xs, and a set of Ys, 
it should be able to figure out the relationship between them.

This is obviously a very different paradigm than what you might be used to, so let's step through it piece by piece.
